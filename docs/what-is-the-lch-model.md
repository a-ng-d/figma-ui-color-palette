# What is the LCH model?

Every variant from a starting color is created by using the LCH (Lightness-Chroma-Hue) color model. It works like the HSL (Hue-Saturation-Lightness) color model. The HSL is simple to use to build a color system, because the lightness can just be changed to create variants. The LCH too, but the Chroma, and the Hue are automatically adjusted to keep the colors within the [sRGB gamut](https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/#1-we-actually-get-access-to-about-50-more-colors).

This article features a comparison between both LCH and HSL color model usage: [LCH is the best color space for UI](https://atmos.style/blog/lch-color-space).
