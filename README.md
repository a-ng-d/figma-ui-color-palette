# UI Color Palette
UI Color Palette is a Figma and FigJam plugin creating consistent and accessible color palettes specifically for UI. The plugin uses the alternative color space from `RGB` and `HSL`, like `LCH`, `OKLCH`, `CIELAB`, `OKLAB`, and `HSLuv`, to create color shades according to the chosen lightness scale. These spaces are relevant to make these shades compliant with the [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and guarantee enough contrast between the information and its background color. The idea to make this Figma plugin comes from the article: [Accessible Palette: stop using HSL for color systems](https://wildbit.com/blog/accessible-palette-stop-using-hsl-for-color-systems).

This plugin will allow you to:
- Create a complete palette from any existing color to help you build a color system.
- Adjust the color palette in real-time to control the contrast.
- Deploy the color palette by publishing it as local styles and variables or exporting it as code for several platforms.
