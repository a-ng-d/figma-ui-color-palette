# UI Color Palette
UI Color Palette is a Figma and FigJam plugin that creates consistent and accessible color palettes specifically for UI. The plugin uses alternative color spaces, like `LCH`, `OKLCH`, `CIELAB`, `OKLAB`, and `HSLuv`, to create color shades based on the configured lightness scale. These spaces ensure [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) compliance and sufficient contrast between information and background color.

The idea to make this Figma plugin comes from the article: [Accessible Palette: stop using HSL for color systems](https://wildbit.com/blog/accessible-palette-stop-using-hsl-for-color-systems).

This plugin will allow you to:
- Create a complete palette from any existing color to help you build a color scaling (or Primitive colors).
- Manage the color palette in real-time to control the contrast.
- Sync the color shades with local styles, variables, and third-party plugins.
- Generate code in various languages.
- Publish the palette for reuse across multiple documents or add shared palettes from the community.
