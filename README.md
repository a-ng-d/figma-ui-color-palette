# UI Color Palette
UI Color Palette is a Figma and Figjam plugin creating consistent and accessible Color Palettes. The plugin uses the LCH model to create colors according to the chosen lightness scale. This model is relevant to make colors compliant with the [WCAG 2.2 standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and APCA. The idea to make this Figma plugin comes from the article: [Accessible Palette: stop using HSL for color systems](https://wildbit.com/blog/accessible-palette-stop-using-hsl-for-color-systems).
